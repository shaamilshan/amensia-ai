# Useless Hub üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Name]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Shamil V K - St. Joseph's College Devagiri

### Project Description
Useless Hub is a satirical web app filled with intentionally pointless mini-projects designed to waste your time in absurd and hilarious ways. From vanishing notes to fake bomb diffusers, it offers interactive experiences that do nothing‚Äîon purpose.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world obsessed with productivity and purpose, there‚Äôs a severe lack of digital spaces where people can waste time guilt-free. Useless Hub solves the critical non-problem of having too much meaning on the internet.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Useless Hub provides a curated collection of interactive nonsense‚Äîmini-projects designed to waste your time in creative, confusing, and comically pointless ways. It‚Äôs not productive, it‚Äôs not helpful, and that‚Äôs exactly the point.
